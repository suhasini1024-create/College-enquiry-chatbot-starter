## Data Collection

The chatbot uses a predefined dataset of frequently asked questions 
collected from college enquiry desks and official college websites.

The data is stored in JSON format, where each entry consists of a 
question keyword and its corresponding answer.

This approach ensures fast responses and easy modification of data 
without altering the program logic.
