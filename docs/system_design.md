## Project Scope

The College Enquiry Chatbot is designed to assist students by answering 
frequently asked questions related to the college.

The chatbot focuses on predefined queries and provides instant responses 
without human intervention.

Scope includes:
- Admission-related queries
- Course and department information
- Fee structure details
- College timings and facilities
- Placement and contact information

The chatbot does not handle complex conversational queries or real-time 
database updates and is intended for informational purposes only.
## Functional Requirements

1. The chatbot should accept user questions as input.
2. The chatbot should identify keywords from the question.
3. The chatbot should match the question with predefined FAQs.
4. The chatbot should display the appropriate response.
5. The chatbot should handle unknown queries gracefully.
